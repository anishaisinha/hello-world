# hello-world

Hi there, its Anisha Sinha.
I currently am a student completing my B-tech. I am looking forward for opportunities to explore myself.
I surely am a really good listener and learner. 
I would like to enjoy my chores in web-development, database management and obviosly some kind of proggramming issues. :)
